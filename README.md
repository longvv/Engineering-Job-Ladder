## 1. Introduction

This document outlines our company's engineering job ladder, providing clear, measurable criteria for each level. It serves as a comprehensive guide for engineers to self-assess their current level, understand what's needed for advancement, and plan their career growth within our organization.

## 2. Job Levels Overview

Our engineering ladder consists of six levels for individual contributors:

Junior Engineer (L1)
Mid-level Engineer (L2)
Senior Engineer (L3)
Staff Engineer (L4)
Principal Engineer (L5)
Distinguished Engineer (L6)

Note: This ladder focuses on individual contributor roles. A separate management track exists for those interested in engineering management positions (e.g., Engineering Manager, Director of Engineering, VP of Engineering). Typically, engineers at L3 (Senior Engineer) and above may be considered for management roles, depending on their interests and the organization's needs.

## 3. Level Definitions and Self-Assessment Criteria

For each level, we define specific, measurable criteria across five key dimensions:

- Technical Skills
- Project Complexity
- Leadership and Influence
- Business Impact
- Cross-functional Collaboration

Each criterion is rated on a scale of 1-5:
1. Novice
2. Advanced Beginner
3. Competent
4. Proficient
5. Expert

Engineers should aim to consistently demonstrate proficiency (level 4) in most criteria for their current level and show growth towards the next level.

1. Discuss your ideas with your manager during your regular 1:1s
2. Submit your suggestions to the Engineering Career Development Committee via our internal feedback form
3. Participate in our annual engineering survey, which includes questions about the career ladder

We review all feedback and update the ladder annually to ensure it continues to serve the needs of our engineering organization.

## 13. FAQ

[Content remains the same as in the previous version, with the addition of the following question]

Q: How can I visualize my career progression?

A: Here's a simplified flowchart of potential career paths within our engineering organization:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Junior Engineer L1] --> B[Mid-level Engineer L2]
    B --> C[Senior Engineer L3]
    C --> D[Staff Engineer L4]
    C --> E[Engineering Manager]
    D --> F[Principal Engineer L5]
    D --> G[Senior Engineering Manager]
    F --> H[Distinguished Engineer L6]
    F --> I[Technical Specialist Track]
    G --> J[Director of Engineering]
    H --> K[Chief Architect]
    J --> L[VP of Engineering]
    K --> M[CTO]
    L --> M
```

This chart shows both the individual contributor path (ending at Distinguished Engineer or Chief Architect) and the management path (ending at VP of Engineering or CTO). The Technical Specialist track is an alternative path for those who want to deepen their expertise without taking on increased management responsibilities.

Remember, these paths are flexible, and it's possible to move between IC and management roles as your career evolves.
